# About this fork

This fork contains an MPD server component that is using more recent
protocol than upstream.  Hopefully one day, this separate work is no
longer needed.  It is based on PR's like
[PR#1780](https://github.com/owntone/owntone-server/pull/1780) and
[PR#1793](https://github.com/owntone/owntone-server/pull/1793).


# OwnTone

OwnTone is a media server that lets you play audio sources such as local files,
Spotify, pipe input or internet radio to AirPlay 1 and 2 receivers, Chromecast
receivers, Roku Soundbridge, a browser or the serverâ€™s own sound system. Or you
can listen to your music via any client that supports mp3 streaming.

You control the server via a web interface, Apple Remote, an Android remote
(e.g. Retune), an MPD client, json API or DACP.

OwnTone also serves local files via the Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP) to
iTunes (Windows), Apple Music (macOS) and Rhythmbox (Linux), and via the Roku
Server Protocol (RSP) to Roku devices.

Runs on Linux, BSD and macOS.

OwnTone was previously called forked-daapd, which again was a rewrite of
mt-daapd (Firefly Media Server).
